## About <a name="about"></a>

Calculators is a page dedicated to solving relatively simple math problems such as, circumference, radius, diameter, and quadratic equations. My vision and background for this single page is that various maths equations & formulas can be integrated into a single page with the help of JavaScript, I believe this page will be a very useful page for (currently) basic to more comprehensive calculator tools (Future developments).
